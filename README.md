<h4 align="center">Known as "Nico"</h5>
<h3 align="center">Backend Developer and Student</h3>

I'm a High Schooler obsessed with using [`Node.js`] to make cool projects in **TypeScript** and **JavaScript**. In addition to that I am also proficent in **Java** and **Python** and using tools like **Docker** for scaling my projects. I am currently learning **Rust ðŸ¦€** and **C/C++**.

### You can see my showcased projects by looking at my pinned repos.

### Projects I am involved with:
* [`Discord.js`](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js), A JavaScript library for the Discord API. I have been a long time user of Discord.js and have made a number of contributions to the Library.
* [`Discord-API-Types`](https://github.com/discordjs/discord-api-types), TypeScript typings for various Discord API versions.
