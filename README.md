<!---
I'm a High Schooler obsessed with using [`Node.js`] to make cool projects in **TypeScript** and **JavaScript**. In addition to that I am also proficent in **Java** and **Python** and using tools like **Docker** and **Kubernetes** for scaling my projects. I am currently learning **Rust ðŸ¦€** and **C/C++**.

My most notable projects:
* [`Yoki`](https://github.com/zaida04/Yoki), a modularized discord bot made with Discord Akairo, KnexJS, and TypeScript
* [`Guilded.js`](https://github.com/guildedjs/guilded.js), a library and other tools for the Guilded API.
* [`French-Fry`](https://github.com/zaida04/french-fry), (WIP) Arbitrary code execution server using Docker made with Node.js.
* [`VoiceChat-Moderator`](https://github.com/zaida04/voicechat-moderator), A Discord bot that applies punishments to users who go over a certain volume threshold
-->

<!---
I have contributed to several projects, some of which are:
* [`Discord.js`](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js), A JavaScript library for the Discord API. I have been a long time user of Discord.js and have made a number of contributions to the Library.
* [`Discord-API-Types`](https://github.com/discordjs/discord-api-types), TypeScript typings for various Discord API versions.
