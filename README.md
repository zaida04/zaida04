Howdy there, I'm Zaid but others online call me Nico! I've been coding since middle school and have great personal interest in building Discord bots, APIs, and creating API wrappers. I take great pride in my work and am always down to learn new stuff and use new resources.

### Currently rockin' these langs and tools:
* [`TypeScript 🧰`] and [`JavaScript 💡`] using the [`Node.js ⚙️`] Runtime. Learned by spending years fooling around with Discord bots, APIs, and HTTP Servers
* [`Java ☕`] Learned through school courses and building Spigot server plugins & Forge mods.
* [`Python 🐍`] Learned through personal usage and messing around with.
* [`Docker 🐳 / docker-compose`] Used in various projects to manage deploying applications and servers
* [`MongoDB 🍃`] Used in various projects to store data
* [`PostgreSQL 🐘`] Used in various projects to store data
### Trying to learn:
* [`C 💤`]
* [`Rust 🦀`]
* [`Haskell 🧮`]
* [`Kubernetes ☸️`]
