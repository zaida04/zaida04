I'm a High Schooler obsessed with using [`Node.js`] to make cool projects in [`TypeScript`] and [`JavaScript`]. Some of my most notable projects are [`Yoki`] and [`VoiceChat Moderator`] which are both Discord Bots. I also enjoy making API wrappers like [`Quizizz.js`] and [`Guilded-js`]. Some contributions I have made to other projects are [`Discord.js`], which is a Node.js wrapper for the Discord API and [`discord-api-types`] which is a collection of typings for the Discord API. I am very interested in learning [`Rust ðŸ¦€`] and [`C++`].
