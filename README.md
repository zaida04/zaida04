<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Zaid</h1> 
<h4 align="center">Known as "Nico"</h5>
<h3 align="center">Backend Developer and Student</h3>

I'm a High Schooler obsessed with using [`Node.js`] to make cool projects in **TypeScript** and **JavaScript**. My most notable projects are [`Yoki`], which is a Discord Bot focused on providing a suite of tools to server moderators, and [`Guilded.js`], a library for the Guilded.gg platform. I have contributed to several projects, such as [`Discord.js`], a JS library for the discord API and [`DAPI-types`], API Typings written in TS for the discord API.

The languages that I am proficient in addition to the above are **Java** and **Python**. I am currently learning **Rust ðŸ¦€** and **C/C++**.
